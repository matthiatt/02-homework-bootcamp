              <p class="aboutMe-P">
                I was born and raised in Illinois. For the most part I lived in
                Chicago until my parents got divorced. Once they got divorced, I
                then moved to the suburbs; specifically by Roselle, Illinois. My
                mom was a project manager for a company called - Tellabs. They
                were a communcations company, but they are no longer around
                today. My father was a labour, he usually went from job to job,
                whatever was paying the highest for work, he never specialized
                in a type of skill.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="aboutMe-P">
                Eventually I went to a high school at Lake Park, which was in
                Roselle and Medinah. I didn't move again, the school is so
                massive that it had two campuses. The one in Roselle was
                considered to be west campus, while east campus was in Medinah.
                While there, I played football for the school. I played on the
                defensive line until I lost 100 pounds, then I played middle
                line-backer. I also played baseball, but I didn't play for the
                school, I played for a travel team after football season.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="aboutMe-P">
                After my time at Lake Park High School, I decided that I wanted
                to go to college to further my education. I got accepted to a
                vast amount of colleges, but unfortunatly I could only pick
                in-state colleges at the time(that's all my mother could offord.
                - I am very gratful though I got an oppertunity). Out of all the
                colleges I applied to, I decided to become a Red Bird at
                Illinois State University. It would be there where I would find
                myself, my long-time friends, and memories I still hold till
                this day.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="aboutMe-P">
                At Illinois State I tried a lot of majors to see what I would
                really enjoy. At first it was Kinesiology(the study of anatomy),
                but that didn't work for me. I found out that I prefer to have
                that as a hobby, rather than a career. There were a lot of other
                majors I tried, but after a year and a half I found a subject
                that I enjoyed, English Education. I enjoyed English becuase it
                taught people how to critically think, use context to support
                claims, attention to detail, and if you can effectivly read,
                then you can practically teach yourself anything you want. I
                ended up not wanting to teach though after I completed my
                clinical hours.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="aboutMe-P">
                In 2017 I graduated with my degree in English Education, the
                first in my family to graduate from college so my mom was super
                proud of me. I didn't want to stop my education there though.
                Not only becuase I didn't want to be a teacher, but becuase I
                had a love for learning. To me, knowledge is more valuable than
                anything else in this world. I like to tell people that I value
                knowledge over money. Money comes and money goes, but once
                someone has the knowledge to do something, then no one can take
                that away from you; it's simply priceless.
              </p>

              <p class="aboutMe-P">
                So then my next chapter in my life started, I was going to get
                my 2ed degree. I already knew what I wanted to study next -
                Political Science. A lot of people give me weird looks when I
                tell them this, but there are a lot of reasons why I decided to
                make this my second major.

              <ol>
                <li class="list">
                  #1: You learn about psychology - how do people react and why?
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                  #2: You learn about sociology - demographics, culture, and
                  barriers.
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                  #3: You learn about economics - trade and policy.
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                  #4: You learn about philosophy - This one is my favorite. This
                  teaches you on questioning the basic fundamentals of your
                  mental state. Makes you think outside the box on how to solve
                  problems and learn how to problem solve in a unique manner.
